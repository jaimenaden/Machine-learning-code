# Machine-learning-code

# The above codes was used for my univeristy thesis to fulfil the following: 
# Investigate the Google's stock data taken from Lobster academic data that stems from NASDAQ Historical TotalView-ITCH directory in the month of August 2017.
# Compare traditional and modern prediction techniques when predicting liquidity of a financial stock.
# Apply machine learning on liquidation (Particularly LSTM model).
# Make predictions in financial markets using machine learning techniques.
# Investigate hyper-parameters to obtain the best model.

# I applied the LSTM model for 3 layers, 3 layers with dropouts and 100 layers
# Different hyperparameters was used, namely 3 types of activation functions and 4 types of optimisers
# 3 types of activation functions- Linear, ReLu, Sigmoid
# 4 types of optimisers- SGD, Adam, AdaDelta, RMSprop

# Data: 
# GOOGL's message file and orderbook file on a certain day
# And merged version (file is too big) 
# But file consists of one month of limit order book data that could be taken from Lobster academic website
